[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFRT56raOGk) There’s a passage where the Buddha's giving advice on how to counsel someone who's dying. And the advice assumes that the person has some level of attainment of meditation, but still it's good advice for everybody. And good advice to keep in mind, in case you don't have anybody hovering around giving you advice when you die.  

 &nbsp;

 &nbsp;

**The first thing the Buddha said is to ask the person,** ***Are you worried about your family?***  
And, if the person says ‘yes’, you have to remind the person, *You're dying now, there's nothing you can do about them*.  
Because otherwise what happens is, when you die (as Buddha said), you latch on to a craving: and that takes you on to the next life, to the next body. Then the craving may not necessarily be for another body, but it may be for a certain situation or certain issue that you're concerned about. And if you're concerned about your family you get reborn in your family.  

Imagine becoming the child of your niece or nephew. Well, maybe nobody in the family is gonna have any kids and you become their dog. You're very protective but still you're a dog. So we've got to cut off all thoughts of your family. They have their karma you have your karma, and you don't want to be hovering around them.  
[1:55](https://youtu.be/vFRT56raOGk?t=115) I knew a woman in Thailand one time who had two sons. Her husband had left her after the second son was born, and he just disappeared. And so she had to raise the two sons herself. And the first son was bright, personable, athletic, good-looking. The second son was none of those. And the mother really showed a lot of favouritism with the first son. Well, it was the first son who died: he hopped on his motorcycle one day to pick up some stuff at the store, and within a few minutes word came back he had been run over.  
And after a week or so she came to see me, and said she had a sense that he was still around the house. Leaving little signs, like if something good was gonna happen that day there'd be a little dollop of clay left in her drawer. If something bad was gonna happen, a little rock. And she wanted him to stay, cuz there's a belief in Thailand that, as long as the body's not cremated, the spirit will hang around. Once it's cremated then the Spirit has no locus, it will move on. So she wanted to have the bodies stored away until she died.  
I had to talk to her and say lookm, keeping him around the house: it's a miserable life being a spirit, hovering around a house, no matter how much you love your family. Let him go.  
So she finally had the body cremated and, sure enough, things quieted down. So you don't want to be hovering around your family, you’ve got to cut off thoughts of your family. And if you're not on good terms with your family, cut off thoughts of revenge about your family: because those, too, will pull you back. Thinking about how somebody in the family wronged you, you don't want that to be the craving that determines where you're gonna be reborn.

[4:01](https://youtu.be/vFRT56raOGk?t=241) **Then the next step is to ask the person,** ***Are you afraid of missing human sensual pleasures?*** And if the person says ‘yes’, you’ve gotta remind the person of the drawbacks of human sensual pleasures.  

One way of doing that is to remind the person there are better pleasures in higher levels of heaven. But then, of course, as you go up the levels of heaven, the sensual pleasures there have their drawbacks too. This is another one of the things that pulls us back. There's a certain pleasure we had in this lifetime, and you miss it, and you wanna have it again. And the prospect suddenly appears to you as you're dying  that you could have that pleasure again, or maybe something better, something nicer. And you go for it: you sign the contract without looking at the fine print. And part of the fine print, of course, is that you're gonna get a body. And if it's a human body it's got all the drawbacks of a human body. Yhis is why we have that chant on the 32 parts of the body: you're gonna get a body with these parts, and each of these parts has its diseases. It's one of the contemplations the Buddha has you focus on while you're sick, just in case you happen to die of the illness: to remind yourself that this illness that you have is not a chance thing, it's been waiting for you. Every part of the body has a disease waiting for you, not just one disease, many diseases. In fact, Ajaan Fuang interprets the passage: he says the different parts of the body are diseases. Think about it: each little cell is programmed to grow, and it's the other cells around it that get it to stop, otherwise if the cell just grew and grew and grew it would become a cancer and kill you. So if each little part had its way it would take over, it would malfunction. So the parts are just waiting to malfunction. We're lucky that we get the body to function at all. So if you go for human sensual pleasures this is what you're gonna be stuck with. The body that's ready to grow ill, the body that's going to age.  

There’s passage in the Canon says, *aging drops on you as if out of nowhere, and the body you used to know is not there anymore, it's been replaced by something else*. And it doesn't ask permission. Again, when you latch onto the body, it’s not the case that the body has agreed that it's going to do what you want. It feels no obligation to you no matter how well you take care of it. […]

[7:43](https://youtu.be/vFRT56raOGk?t=463) You can't guarantee that you're going to have a healthy body all the time. Or even a sound body, or a complete one. This is just part of the fine print of signing under sensual pleasures. The other of course is the position of being in slavery to sensual pleasures is not really good place to be: it's one of the reasons why the Buddha has you think about all the drawbacks of sensuality.  

One of his images that's pretty vivid around here at the monastery is when a raptor, it gets a little piece of meat, it has to fly away [to] make sure other raptors don't get it. And if they attack it, sometimes it has to let go otherwise they’ll kill it. The Buddha says, that’s sensuality. Our sensual pleasures are like a bead of honey on the blade of a very sharp knife. To enjoy that little bit of honey you have to be extremely careful. There's a lot of pleasures in the world you can enjoy only in a very dangerous situation. Knowing you got them, other people want them.  
So the Buddha has you reflect on the drawbacks of the body and the drawbacks of sensuality, so that your mind doesn’t go flowing over to human rebirth again. Even Deva sensual pleasures have their drawbacks. It is possible, on some levels of the Deva realms, to practice the Dhamma… but it's so easy to get carried away. You get these pleasures you never had before, and part of the mind says, well let me enjoy them for a while and then I'll practice. And then you forget.  

So it's good to reflect on these drawbacks to keep the mind from just grabbing at whatever. And to look for something better. This is why we practice for the Deathless, this is why we practice for dispassion. They keep in mind fact there is something better than these things.
