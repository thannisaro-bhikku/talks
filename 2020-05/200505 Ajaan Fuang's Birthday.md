More than one title was possible for this one. Here are some of the other options I could have gone with:

* He thought of a passage in the Canon where it talks about the monk who travels with his bowl as his only burden, in the same way the bird flies with its wings as its only burden. He felt a great sense of freedom.  
* As Ajaan Fuang said, the Buddha decide he was going to be born for the sake of the perfections, every time he took birth. That's a good vow to take on, that no matter where you're born you're gonna be born for the sake of the perfections…
* And this is the story of all the Thai Ajaans: most of them were born in pretty poor circumstances, but as Ajaan Mun taught them, simply the fact that you're a human being, you're already in the supreme position for awakening… it's in the human birth that the highest foundation for the practice is found.
* So ask yourself, here you are born -- what's next? Think about the Buddha’s memory of his lifetimes, there was birth, pleasure, pain, feeding, death. That's the common course of life. If you want to make it uncommon you can do so by developing the perfections. The choice is yours.

[3:51](https://youtu.be/zbhlvEUo2-s?t=231) Now that was back in the days when they were beginning to have some textbooks that actually explained what was in the Pali Canon. Prior to that, if you studied in a monastery out in the countryside, who knows what you'd learn. In the early 20th century, Bangkok was producing some textbooks and so he was reading about the Vinaya and began to realize that his life there at the monastery had very little to do with the rules of the Vinaya. He was beginning to get discouraged, so he gave himself two years. He said that at the end of the two years he hadn't met anybody who really inspired him he’d disrobe. And, fortunately, during his second rains retreat he met Ajaan Lee. 

 &nbsp;

[6:13](https://youtu.be/zbhlvEUo2-s?t=373) And so Ajaan Fuang was able to join Ajaan Lee. And there, he said, that's where he learned the brightness of life.  
One of my favourite stories of his early time with Ajaan Lee is they went on tudong together one time with several other monks. And so, the other monks were carrying Ajaan Lee's umbrella tent and his bowl, his bag of provisions -- not provisions, but his bag of things he needed up there in the forest. And Ajaan Fuang realized, if you're gonna keep up with Ajaan Lee you’d have to follow right in his footsteps, you couldn't let yourself fall back because otherwise you'd lose him. Which is exactly what happened: all the other monks got lost.  
And so when the evening came he and Ajaan Lee found themselves on a mountaintop with nobody else around. So Ajaan Fuang set up his umbrella tent, the two of them shared the umbrella tent that night. He massaged Ajaan Lee's legs a little bit, and then sat and meditated. He thought of a passage in the Canon where it talks about the monk who travels with his bowl as his only burden, in the same way the bird flies with its wings as its only burden. He felt a great sense of freedom.

[8:53](https://youtu.be/zbhlvEUo2-s?t=533) There are lessons you can learn from his story. One is you can’t judge people by the details of their birth. I remember going to his home village, it was really poor. I remember we talked one time about the ordination hall at the monastery there, he said it had a really nice mural, up on the ceiling. A mural of samsara. When we actually got to saw it was pretty sad. But you imagine for a little kid born out in the countryside it was something.  
And he was born into a place with a lot of misunderstandings about the teachings. The word for Nirvana in Thai, niphphān, is very close to the name for the Himalayan mountains. So when he was young he thought that that's what the practice was for, was to go to the Himalayan mountains.  So [there were] a lot of misunderstandings he had to work through, but he was able to do it. He decided at that time when he’d looked at his life that, if his life was gonna have any meaning at all, he was gonna have to work on his perfections… The darkness in where you’re born has to do with the material and other circumstances into which you're born [As Ajaan Fuang was born and raised in a poor village without good teaching of the Dhamma], but where you go has to do with what you make of your life. So how you’re born doesn’t matter, it’s how you go.
As Ajaan Fuang said, the Buddha decide he was going to be born for the sake of the perfections *every time he took birth*. That's a good vow to take on, that no matter where you're born you're gonna be born for the sake of the perfections, for the sake of developing your generosity, your virtue, your powers of renunciation, your discernment, your persistence, your endurance, your truth, your determination, your goodwill and your equanimity. These things, if you develop them, make your birth worthwhile.  
Because, here we are, born. What happens after birth? Well there's ageing, illness and death, that's for sure. But above and beyond that, what do you actually want to get out of life? What do you want to gain from all the pain that comes from having to be born?  
[12:58](https://youtu.be/zbhlvEUo2-s?t=778) We've all been born in relative comfort, but that's not what gives life meaning. It's what you do with it, how you dedicate it. And this is the story of all the Thai Ajaans: most of them were born in pretty poor circumstances, but as Ajaan Mun taught them, simply the fact that you're a human being, you're already in the supreme position for awakening… it's in the human birth that the highest foundation for the practice is found. It doesn't matter whether you're poor or rich, male female, what’s your background: you've got the potential within you, to work on your perfections, to work for the sake of awakening. That's what gives your life meaning. As Ajaan Fuang said, if he hadn't found Ajaan Lee, he probably would have been a small-time gangster. We never would have heard of him. But because he gave himself to the perfections he's become an example to all of us.  
So ask yourself, here you are born -- what's next? Think about the Buddha’s memory of his lifetimes, there was birth, pleasure, pain, feeding, death. That's the common course of life, each lifetime. If you want to make it uncommon you can do so by developing the perfections. The choice is yours.
