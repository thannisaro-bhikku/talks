[1:31](https://youtu.be/4e2h9tf_ACc?t=91) But all beings have duties. As the Buddha said, everybody except arahants has debts. We’ve come into this world but we take hold of a body, and the body has its needs. And we need to depend on the suffering of others for our food, our clothing, our shelter, medicine. We have that chant every night to think about these things. Now that society has come to a halt, come to a pause, we bring to realise how dependent we are on the suffering of a lot of beings, just to keep going.

[8:09](https://youtu.be/4e2h9tf_ACc?t=489) You find that you’ve gotten involved in this world of the six senses because of your desires. You’ve taken on all these duties that are occasioned by your desires: the only way out is to drop the desires. And then you’re free. For a lot of people this sounds like extinction, going out of existence. And simply you’re no longer taking on the identity of being a being within the realm of the six senses… And how you would be described at that point, the Buddha says you’re immeasurable, undefinable. Because people are defined by their desires, the desires that force the duties on them. Because as long as you’re involved in space and time, that’s the issue: time keeps coming… The things you do in space and time, as long as they only point into space and time, always have this ‘what next’, and there’s always a duty that comes with that. That’s when you can step out, through disenchantment, that’s when the duties are done.
