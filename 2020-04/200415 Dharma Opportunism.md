Following on the from quote in the title:  

> [\[4:29\]](https://youtu.be/JNW_PPW2e_o?t=269): You may not be able to give your full attention to the breath, but it is possible, as you go through your activities. Stay with the breath energy in the body. Try and keep it as open and clear as possible. You only have a few spare moments? Okay, go there, don't go to the mind's incessant chatter. Try to create some break in the chatter, tell yourself you have better things to do, things that are better for you right now.
