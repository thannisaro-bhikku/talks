That requires that you train the mind, at all times. In times of peace, in times of no-peace. In times of illness, in times of no-illness. The mind always has to be trained. Because the potential for ageing, illness and death is always there. The potential for social unrest is always there, thinks of those dangers that the Buddha has the monk reflect on... I need to develop an attainment that makes me safe, so that even when these things do come, I don't have to suffer. That may seem selfish, working for your own wellbeing that way, as everything else falls apart. But you're not making things fall apart. And part of the practice, of course, is generosity, virtue, you give things. You give of your time, you give of your energy, you give of your knowledge. You're happy to share what you have. And then you refrain from harming. These are things you want to keep in mind at all times."
