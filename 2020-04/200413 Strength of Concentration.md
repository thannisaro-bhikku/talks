This dhamma talk is about how to make a space in the mind to let go of things. What to let go of? Try the next talk on the [*Strength of Discernment*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwcVARheS28).

There are specifics given on how to let go. In terms of anger:  
> The same goes for anger that you're carrying around, is it worth carrying around? "Well, so and so did this, it really was bad," well, does it really matter? And do you need to carry that around right now?  
> If you could have an image in your mind of all the things the mind carries around, think of it as being like a big burden you've placed on your shoulders, and how huge that burden can be. And how if you saw somebody carrying a load like that around, you'd feel really sorry for them. "Why do you carry it around? There's nobody forcing you, you can put it down."  
> Part of the mind will complain about putting it down, but look into that part of the mind that's complaining about putting it down. "It's not right, I won't get back at that person, justice won't be done." Justice is rarely done in the world. Once one person's idea of justice has been carried out, the other people don't like it, and they're gonna come back. And the world has this back and forth, back and forth, who knows how long it's been going on? When you can think in this way then it's easier to put it down.
