> 0:00: One of Ajahn Lee’s favourite teachings was that, when you take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, the real refuge is when you internalise their qualities. If you take refuge simply on the external level -- the Buddha as the person who lived 2,600 years ago; the Dharma that dharma found in books; the Sangha as the noble sangha, someone else out there -- it’s not that secure a refuge. After all, the Buddha has passed away. The dharma that’s just in the books is not going to come out and help you. And even if there are members of the noble sangha still alive, they can do only so much for you. The real problems of the mind are inside, it’s only when you have good qualities inside that you are safe from those problems. And, as refuge means, developing those qualities inside you.

> [1:39](https://youtu.be/p_dsmu0frgQ?t=99): Take the qualities of the Buddha. They come down to three: his wisdom (or discernment), his compassion, and his purity. And, as the Buddha taught, wisdom comes from finding answers to the question, “What, when I do it, will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness?” In other words you realise happiness and suffering depend on your actions, long-term happiness is possible, and it’s better than short-term. It’s a very basic principle, but it underlies everything in the path, from the very beginning to the very end. You always go for looking at your actions and then seeing what the long-term consequence is gonna be. And act on what you see is going to have the best long-term consequences.  
That compassion relates directly to that, the principle that each of us loves ourselves dearly, and just as you love yourself very dearly, everybody else loves themselves that dearly. So if your pursuit of happiness is gonna cause them suffering, they’re not gonna stand for it. So if you want your happiness to be long term, you have to take their happiness into consideration. So, again, this is a good quality of mind that comes from searching for your happiness in a responsible way.  
> And then, finally, there’s purity. This, the Buddha says, comes from looking at your actions, before, while and after. Before you do them, you look at the intention to make sure the action is not going to be harmful. While you’re doing it, you check to make sure that unexpected bad results are not coming up: if they are, you stop. And then, finally, when the action is done, you look at what the actual long-term consequences were. And if you see that any harm was done, you resolve not to repeat the mistake, and you go talk it over with someone else who’s more advanced on the path… You’re taking responsibility for your search for happiness, you wanna do it in a way that doesn’t harm anybody, so that the happiness will be long-term. When you think about these three qualities acting together… they pretty much define what it means to be a responsible person.

[6:41](https://youtu.be/p_dsmu0frgQ?t=400): In regards to *paying careful attention to what you do* so that you can avoid repeating actions that produced bad results:  
> This is what make your wisdom and compassion pure, otherwise they’re just well-meaning. But if they’re not right for the time and the place, they can actually cause harm. So be very careful watching your actions and seeing the actual results that come and then learning lessons from them. This tendency we have to say, “well, this is just the sort of person I am,” “well this is what I feel like doing,” “well this is what I feel like saying,” is what stands in the way of purity. It’s as if you basically don’t care: you hold to the rightness of your ideas. And you can talk yourself into saying that they are beneficial, in the abstract they may be. But if you’re not really careful with how you deal with specific people then you’re being irresponsible: you have to care, you have to pay attention. This is one of the reasons why we meditate.  
> Again, a teaching from Ajahn Lee: meditation is a skill, you learn from doing it and then looking at the results, and caring enough to see that, if the results are not good, you’ve gotta go back and change what you did…  
This is one of the problems with the internet, a lot of people spout off, and they don’t see the impact of their words on other people. When you say something to somebody’s face and see their reaction sometimes it tells you, okay, they’re not saying anything but the look on their face tells me something is wrong with what I said.
