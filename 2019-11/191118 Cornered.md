 [[3:50](https://youtu.be/BOMZ1h-eVsE?t=230), continuing on from what is quoted in the title] "So take advantage of that, because some day the body will have you cornered. Illness will come, ageing will come. Death will approach. And the usual ways you have of diverting yourself, distracting yourself -- moving around, fantasizing about this that and the other thing -- those are gonna be no longer available. And you'll be thrown back on how you fabricate your experience, right here, right now."

From [[5:21](https://youtu.be/BOMZ1h-eVsE?t=321)] on is what I think is a very useful description of breath meditation, and the listener is directed into using three forms of fabrication as part of meditation.  
Instruction includes: not to squeeze the breath out, as this doesn't help develop a sense of fullness. Also to note the end of a breath, and "use that moment of poise between the in-breath and the out-breath to spread your awareness, spread a sense of wellbeing and stillness throughout the body."  
This involves verbal, bodily and mental fabrication ("your perceptions, the images you hold in mind, the breath as a whole body process").
